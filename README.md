Data structure 

We decided to try implement a doubly linked list. After a while we realized that this was harder than expected, as we will explain in challenges. 
The reason we wanted to go for a doubly linked list was because this would be an efficient way to build a simple text editor. 
A doubly linked list would allow us to traverse both forward and backwards in the list. 
With a linked list we would also be able to remove or edit in the middle of a list without reducing the performance as with an array. 

When we did not manage to implement the action events, we tried with a linked list inside of a linked list instead. 
This would also give good performance but, but we could still not get the ae to work. 
Therefore, we created a standalone doubly linked list class with a functioning node class. 

Challenges 
At first, we struggled with trying to understand the assignment.
While the explanation worked for explaining what you wanted the code to do, it was challenging to figure out how to 
implement the methods into the framework you already had built for us. 
We also had problems implementing the linked list and having it store the characters we wanted to include in the editor. 
The practical part turned out to be difficult and complicated, and ended up having to resort to the teaching assistant to better explain the theory. 
After having Magnus explaining it for us and showing examples and repositories we could take inspiration from, it all seemed much clearer. 
Unfortunately, though we feel confident in our understanding of the theory, we were not able to implement this properly into our code and ended up having to give it up. 
There were also the usual problems that occur when trying to open a project written in a specific IDEA, into another, and these were as always very frustrating to work with.
